Quantum-bound trade decision commitments.

A QuantumDecisionCommitment cryptographically binds a trade decision to:
1. The account state at decision time (via state hash)
2. The quantum seed used for signing (via seed commitment hash)
3. A temporal window proving the key was destroyed before Shor's could run
4. A strictly incrementing nonce (prevents replays)

Quantum Safety:
    - Signature is only valid with the ephemeral key (destroyed after signing)
    - To forge: need the private key (destroyed) OR solve ECDLP on secp256k1
      (requires ~2330 logical qubits -- current QC: ~5-10)
    - Seed commitment hash proves a specific quantum measurement was used
    - Temporal window proves key expired before Shor's attack window
