Quantum-sealed settlement records.

Final merkle of commitment + execution + settlement, sealed with a THIRD
independent quantum seed.

Quantum Safety of Complete Trade:
    - 3 different quantum measurements (different seeds)
    - 3 different ephemeral keys (all destroyed)
    - 3 temporal windows (all closed before Shor's)
    - Merkle hash proves nothing was modified
    - To forge: need all 3 keys (impossible, destroyed)
      or solve ECDLP 3x (impossible at current QC scale)
