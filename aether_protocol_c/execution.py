Quantum-chained execution attestations.

A QuantumExecutionAttestation proves that an execution matched the
authorised commitment, signed with a DIFFERENT ephemeral key derived
from a DIFFERENT quantum seed.

Chain:
    Commitment Sig (quantum seed #1, destroyed)
          |
    Execution Sig (quantum seed #2, destroyed) [references commitment sig]
          |
    Settlement Sig (quantum seed #3, destroyed) [references both prior sigs]

Quantum Safety:
    - Two independent quantum seeds (commitment + execution)
    - Two independent ephemeral keys (both destroyed)
    - Even if one key is somehow recovered, the other remains safe (P4: PFS)
